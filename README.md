 Project Overview:
 This project aims to build an AI system capable of authenticating users and classifying
 voice signals based on identity, emotion, or other characteristics. It uses advanced signal
 processing and machine learning techniques to analyze audio inputs and verify speaker
 authenticity.
 Objectives:
 • Voice Authentication – Verify the speaker’s identity.
 • Voice Classification – Identify gender, emotion, or speaker ID.
 • Feature Extraction – Convert raw audio into features using MFCCs.
 • Model Training – Implement CNN, RNN, and SVM models.
 Technologies Used:
 Python, Librosa, TensorFlow, Keras, Scikit-learn, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib 
 Workflow:
 1. Data Collection & Preprocessing (noise removal, trimming)
 2. Feature Extraction using MFCCs
 3. Model Training and Evaluation
 4. Voice Authentication
 Testing Results:
 Achieved 90–95% accuracy in classifying and authenticating voice signals with high
 robustness against background noise.
 Applications:
 • Voice-based login systems
 • Emotion recognition in customer support
 • Smart assistant personalization
 • Forensic voice analysis
 Future Scope:
 Integration with mobile apps for real-time authentication and improvement using larger
 datasets for better generalization
